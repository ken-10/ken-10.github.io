## Quick Summary
This discord bot provides a summoner's name, level, rank for each queue type, and the wins, losses, and league points in each queue type. <br/>
It also has other commands such as clearing messages, reacting to your message, and converting a message into all caps. <br/>

## Inspiration
I have been playing League of Legends for fun for the past 8 years, and when I play, I find myself looking up the ranks of my opponents and teammates. However, everytime I did this I needed to go to a third party website to search for their information. I thought it would be a quicker way to do it by making a bot that provides this information with a single line command. There was no better application to do it in than Discord because Discord is one of the most popular gaming communication platforms today and I use it everytime I play video games.

## What it does
This bot simply provides a player's name, level, and rank for all queue types along with their wins, losses, and league points. This can be done with a simple command **!summoner** followed by their summoner name. Ex: **!summoner Ken10**

## Future Improvements
There is a lot of room for this bot to grow as League of Legends has more to it than just basic information of a player. I plan to allow users to easily find counters of a certain champion, runes, and allow them to search for users in certain regions. I also want to be able to one day deploy the bot if I am satisfied with it.
