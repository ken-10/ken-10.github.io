# Overview
BowFolios Mobile is an mobile app of the original BowFolios web application. Users have the ability to create a profile, add interests, and profiles. It provides the ability to view and modify profiles, projects, and interests. It is a quick way to find other UH Manoa students with the same interests and view their previous and current projects. 

For Milestone 1, we created the user interface for the login, create account, profiles, interests, projects, drawer navigation, and set up firebase for backend data storage and user authentication.

For Milestone 2, we plan to implement backend features to the profiles, interests, and projects page. We also want to route the widgets in the drawer navigation.

For Milestone 3, we plan to implement a search page that filters profiles by interests, user profiles page, show profile cards on profiles page, show profiles and projects based on chosen interest on the interests page, and show project cards on projects page.

# Developer Guide
This section provides information on how to get the application to run on a developers local machine.

### Installation
First, follow the steps [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to get flutter set up.

Install a virtual mobile device from here:
* [Android Studios](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* iOS Emulator (Mac Only) You must download and install XCode from the App store.

Once flutter is installed, clone the [repo](https://github.com/yertnek/bowfolios).

Next change directories into the projects folder and run the command:
```
$ flutter pub get
```

Make sure you have a virtual device running, and start the application by running the following command:
```
$ flutter run
```
The application will take a little while to start up, but once it does you should land on a login page and you are all set to use the app!
