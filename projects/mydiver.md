## myDiver Web Application
This web application allows users to plan their dive sessions through our website.<br/>
Our algorithm implements the PADI table by putting the PADI table data into hash tables.<br/>
The user interface was created by using Semantic UI React.<br/>
<br/>
This web application was created for my ICS 414 project at University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Fall 2019. I was mostly in charge of developing the user interface and the website interaction with the user.<br/>
