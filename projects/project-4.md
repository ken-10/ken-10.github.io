summary: Web application built for our ICS 314 Final Project that showcases the variety of food vendors in UH Manoa Campus
---

## Overview
Ono Manoa Grindz is a web application built to showcase the variety of food vendors operating in UH Manoa Campus. Users of this application are able to view and search for a list of vendors. There is a page for each vendor that displays the operation hours, menu, and reviews. Users may also submit their own review for a vendor.

## Contributions
My contribution to this project was creating the landing page and working on the user interface on the landing page, navigation bar, and footer, and deploying the final project to Meteor Galaxy. I also assisted with creating the component that allows users to add reviews, and implementing the search bar.

## Learning Outcome
From this project, I was able to experience how it was working in a team oriented software project. We were able to work on most of the project independently by planning out when we can communicate outside of class ahead of time. When problems arose, we communicated through an application called Discord to help one another in solving the issue. We also discussed and worked on the application during class time. I gained some knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Meteor to build the application itself and used Galaxy to deploy the application to a domain. Finally, I learned how to overcome obstacles that occur during the project with a team. During a final hours of the project, we met an issue with deploying our project to Galaxy. Our project was failing health checks, causing the deployment to abort every time. We couldn't solve the problem for almost a whole day, but with perseverance, I was able to get help and finally deploy the project.
