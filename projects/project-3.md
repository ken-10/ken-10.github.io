[CLG at PGL NA Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcpR-npEPvI) is a client work I did for Counter Logic Gaming. I made 1 minute 18 second video that was a highlight reel of Counter Logic Gaming's (CLG) professional Counter-Strike Global Offensive team at the PGL NA Minor tournament back in 2017. It was also a competition againts three other editors for getting a position on the team as their video editor, but unfortunately, I was not able to get the position. The video was made using the Counter-Strike Global Offensive game, HLAE tool, nVidia Shadowplay, Adobe After Effects, and Sony Vegas Pro.

Although, I was not able to obtain the position as CLG's editor, I am glad I took on this project because it taught me how to work with clients when it comes to freelancing.
