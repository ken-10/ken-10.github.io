summary: A web application that allows Hawaii State Archives to crowdsource the indexing effort by gamifying it.

---

# Purpose
Project CLIO was created as a submission to the Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge 2020. The challenge was created to provide opportunity for civic engagement to the local technology community to create innovative solutions in state functions and services. Another objective of this challenge is to facilitate information technology workforce development and stimulate the development of ideas that may lead to technology business and economic development for the participants. One of the challenges presented was to develop a online platform that allows Hawai'i State Archives to gamify and crowdsource their indexing, which my team and I have chose to tackle.

# What is Project CLIO?
Project CLIO is a web application created with React & Javascript for the front-end and Spring & Java for the back-end of the application. The web application categorizes users into four categories: rookie, indexer, proofer, and archivist. The rookie role is a role every user is assigned when they first sign up and they must go through training of how to index archives. After the tutorial is complete, the are promoted to an indexer. Indexer are regular users that can index archives and do other basic user functions such as edit their profile and view leaderboards. Proofers are users who can proof-read index submissions by indexers and can decide whether the submission passes or not. Archivists are the admins of the website where they can do every function of every user below them and on top of that, they may export submissions in a CSV file, create new archives to be indexed, and categories. Badges and leaderboards are utilized to create a gaming aspect in hopes to encourage users to index archives. Below is a link to a video that shows how the website functions. <br/>

We were able to split up the work evenly between us five members. Trey, Gum, and I were assigned to the back-end of the application, while Arsland and Jenny were responsible for the front-end of the website.
